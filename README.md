[Neuromuskuloskeletal Health Laboratory](https://coe.uga.edu/research/labs/neuromusculoskeletal-health-laboratory) Ultrasound Plugin 
--------------------------------------------------------
This plugin is designed to specifically target the challenges presented in processing ultrasound images of children with muscular disorders. 
By using ImageJ as a base, the user can use all default ImageJ functionality. 
But this plugin also adds support for multiple different measurement procedures performed within the lab.
These procedures makes it easier for someone less experienced to perform measurements and reduce the number of clicks required by roughly 40% when compared to manual processing.
This plugin also automatically organizes the collected data onto a data table that can easily be exported to Excel or other similar program.
Lastly for cross-sectional echo intensity and area, a semi-automated algorithm is included to isolate muscle groups and take measurements much more efficiently than manual processing.
